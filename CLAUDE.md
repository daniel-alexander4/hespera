## Architecture

### Entry Points

- `cmd/hespera/main.go` — Web server: config → SQLite (WAL) → migrations → Handler → HTTP server, graceful shutdown (10s timeout).
- `cmd/hescli/main.go` — CLI stub for future user/key management.

### Core Packages

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| `internal/config` | Config struct from env vars (HESPERA_ prefix), validation |
| `internal/db` | SQLite WAL setup, connection pooling, schema migrations |
| `internal/auth` | SSH pubkey challenge-response + HMAC-SHA256 session cookies, rate limiting (10/min/IP) |
| `internal/pathguard` | Path traversal prevention (symlink resolution + containment check) |
| `internal/jobs` | Background job queue: buffered channel (128), single worker goroutine, context cancellation |
| `internal/music` | Audio tag reader (`dhowden/tag` wrapper), TrackMeta struct, compilation detection |
| `internal/scan` | Music library scanner: walk dirs, read tags, ensure artist/album/track, art extraction, prune/cleanup |
| `internal/match` | MusicBrainz matching pipeline, Cover Art Archive, artist enrichment (Wikipedia/Wikimedia), scoring |
| `internal/tmdb` | TMDB client + movie/TV matcher; resolves date-based episodes against episode air dates post-match (`airdate.go`) |
| `internal/tvscan` | TV file identification (SxE / N×M / folder-authoritative title / air-date) + scanner (writes `stream_info_json` = marshaled `video.ProbeResult`) |
| `internal/video` | ffprobe wrapper + gated ffmpeg execution (`StreamFFmpeg`, `EnsureHLS`), concurrency caps, HLS cache |
| `internal/playback` | Pure TV playback-decision layer: per-client container↔codec matrix → direct-play / remux / transcode |
| `internal/web` | HTTP handlers, routing (`http.ServeMux`), template rendering, logging middleware, TV streaming endpoints |

### Key Patterns

- **Handler DI**: `web.Handler` receives `web.Deps{Cfg, DB}`; `web.New(d)` compiles templates, starts job service, initializes auth.
- **Routing**: stdlib `http.ServeMux`, routes registered in `web.Router()`. Auth middleware wraps entire mux if enabled.
- **Templates**: `html/template` from `web/templates/` at startup. Layout base cloned per page, merged with `partials_*.html` glob. FuncMap: `staticv` (cache-bust), `humanBytes`, `mult`.
- **Theming**: Catppuccin via CSS custom properties in `app.css` — `:root` = Mocha (dark, default), `html[data-mode="light"]` = Latte. A pre-paint script in `layout.html` sets `data-mode` from `localStorage.iso_theme_mode` (first visit follows `prefers-color-scheme`, fallback dark); the `.theme-toggle` sun/moon button in the topbar flips and persists it. Hidden in couch mode (it lives in `.topbar`, which `tv.css` hides).
- **Runtime settings**: `app_settings(key, value)` KV table holds user-set overrides of env config (Settings → API Keys page, `settingsAPIKeys`). Today: `tmdb_api_key`. `Handler.effectiveTMDBKey(ctx)` is the single source of truth — DB value if set, else `cfg.TMDBAPIKey`; read per-call so a UI change takes effect without a restart. Key stored plaintext (same risk as `.env`), masked in the UI, never logged.
- **Database**: `modernc.org/sqlite`, WAL, 8 max open / 4 idle, 5s busy timeout, FK on. Migrations in `db.Migrate()` with `ensureColumn()` for schema evolution.
- **Jobs**: `jobs.Service.Enqueue(jobType, libraryID, createdBy, executor)`. States: queued → running → done/failed/canceled. Progress in `scan_jobs` table.
- **Scanner pattern**: `scan.New(cfg, db)` / `match.New(db, dataDir)` constructed inline per handler call, passed as executor closure to `jobs.Enqueue`.
- **Logging**: `slog` structured JSON to stdout.

### Match Pipeline

- **MBClient**: MusicBrainz API, 1 req/sec rate limiter, 3-strategy query cascade (strict release-group → loose release → artist fallback). Strategy A fetches 25 candidates so the canonical studio release-group isn't crowded out by compilations/EPs of the same title.
- **Scorer**: weighted (title 0-38, artist 0-26, MB score 0-18, type 0-10, year 0-4; max ~96). Single threshold `matchThreshold` (=80): score ≥80 matched, else unmatched. The former "uncertain" tier was retired (migrated to unmatched in `db.Migrate`). `typeBonus` penalizes EP/Single and any non-primary edition — including **secondary types** (Live/Compilation/Remix/Demo on a primary=Album RG) — so a clean studio album outranks art-less alt editions of the same title and the matcher picks the release-group that actually has Cover Art Archive art.
- **CAAClient**: Cover Art Archive, release-group → release fallback, thumbnail size preference. Multi-candidate art search: if the matched release-group has no front cover, `fetchAlbumArt` (`pipeline.go`) probes sibling above-threshold candidates — gated to **same-artist, clean primary=Album, within 8 score points** (so only a same-album edition's cover is reused, never a live/compilation/different-album), RG-level only, capped at 3.
- **Manual art override**: `POST /music/album/art` (form on the album edit page) uploads a cover image when CAA has none or the album mis-matched. Validates server-derived MIME (jpeg/png/webp only), caps 15 MiB (`MaxBytesReader`), writes an album-id-keyed file under `thumbs/music` (temp+rename) and sets `art_path` unconditionally. The scanner/matcher art writers are empty-only-guarded, so manual art survives rescan/rematch. Served via `/art/album/{id}` with `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`. Upload-only (no fetch-by-URL — SSRF).
- **Artist enrichment**: MusicBrainz URL relations → Wikipedia REST API (bio) → Wikidata/Wikimedia Commons (image)
- **Pipeline**: `Matcher.RunMusicMatch()` = enrich artists → match albums → **re-fetch missing art**. The matcher only processes `''`/`unmatched` albums, so a third pass (`refetchMissingArt`) re-runs *only* the cover-art step for `matched` albums still lacking `art_path` — anchored to the album's **stored** MusicBrainz identity (re-search supplies candidate breadth only), gated by an `art_checked_at` TTL (30d) so genuinely art-less albums aren't re-probed every run, and race-guarded on `musicbrainz_id`. This is why a rebuild's matching improvements show up on the next Match. Non-fatal per-album errors.
- **Manual album controls** (album edit page): `POST /music/album/art` (upload cover), `/music/album/art/clear` (clear `art_path` + `art_checked_at` → re-fetched next Match), `/music/album/unmatch` (full reset: identity + art → re-matched next Match). All POST-only under `/music/` (auth + same-origin CSRF).

### TV Streaming

- **Decision** (`internal/playback`): pure, per-client. `Decide()` validates the container↔codec *combination* (not independent codec sets) and returns direct-play / direct-stream (remux) / transcode, failing safe toward transcode on any uncertainty. Text subtitles deliver as a WebVTT sidecar; only bitmap subs force burn-in. Profiles for chrome/firefox/safari with UA inference.
- **Execution** (`internal/video`): `StreamFFmpeg` (gated, kill-on-disconnect) for remux/subtitles; `EnsureHLS` builds a single-rendition **progressive** HLS asset — an *event* playlist that returns as soon as the first segment exists (playback starts in ~sub-second, not after the whole transcode), with the single continuous encode appending segments in the background. Per-key in-flight registry (one ffmpeg per source; concurrent callers share it); failed-before-playable builds leave no dir so the next request retries. Forced keyframes every `hls_time` so segments are actually 6s. `PruneCache` bounds the cache under `DataDir/cache/tv-hls` (in-flight dirs protected by the grace window). Limitation: seeking past the encoded point waits for the encoder; true segment-on-demand is a tracked future upgrade.
- **Endpoints** (`internal/web`): `GET /tv/playback-session` returns the decision + source URL + track lists; `/stream/tv/` (direct), `/stream/tv-remux/`, `/stream/tv-hls/` (manifest+segments), `/stream/tv-subtitles/` (WebVTT). HLS asset names are regex-whitelisted; all paths go through `pathguard`.
- **Art** (`tvArt`, `/art/tv/`): serves `poster`/`backdrop`/`season` images from `tv_series_art`. Season cards are the single source of truth via a cascade — own `season_poster` → series poster → `302` to `/static/tv-poster-placeholder.webp` — so the template always emits the `<img>` (no per-card gate). Many shows lack per-season posters on TMDB (empty `poster_path`), so the series-poster fallback is the common path.
- **Client**: `tv_player.html` calls the session, then plays via `<video>` (direct/remux/native-HLS) or vendored hls.js (`web/static/hls.light.min.js`, Apache-2.0). Single-rendition by design — HLS is for seeking, not adaptive bitrate (a ladder is a future enhancement).
- **Missing seasons/episodes**: `tvSeriesDetail`/`tvSeasonDetail` diff the cached TMDB metadata against present (matched) files and grey out the gaps — pure `missingSeasons`/`missingEpisodes` helpers, no new endpoints/queries/fetches. Specials (season 0) excluded. Reflects last-match-time cache (no live refetch).

### Lyrics / Karaoke

- Synced lyrics via **LRCLIB** (free, no key). `POST /music/lyrics/fetch` (`handlers_music_lyrics.go`) is cache-first against the `lyrics_cache` table, else fetches (exact `get` then fuzzy `search` scored by `pickBestLrcLibCandidate`) and caches the result — **hits and misses both cached**, so a track is fetched at most once. Lazy per-track (no scan job), always on (no integrations gate, consistent with MB/CAA/Wikipedia). `player.html` parses the synced LRC and advances current/next line on `timeupdate`. (No duration tiebreaker — match precision caveat tracked in pending.)

### Test Patterns

- Standard `testing` package with table-driven tests
- `openTestDB(t)` helper creates temp SQLite in `t.TempDir()`
- Direct conditionals with `t.Fatalf()`, no assertion libraries
- HTTP tests use `httptest.NewRequest` / `httptest.NewRecorder`
